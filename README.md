# Minesweeper

- Terminal version of Minesweeper Game.

- Please note: I have altered my code to support keyboard cursor input functionality
- Use `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` arrow keys to move around the grid and `e`, `f`, and `s` to perform actions

#### Ruby Concepts
- `colorize` gem
- `remedy` gem
- Save/load functionality using YAML
- `ARGV` to load in file
- `File` class I/O
- Freezing constants
- Recursion to simplify complicated logic
- Overriding the `inspect` method
